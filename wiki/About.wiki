= Introduction =

SSLAudit is a tool that verifies SSL certificate and supported protocols/ciphers of a SSL-enabled webserver. The result is graded according to [https://www.ssllabs.com/projects/rating-guide/index.html SSLLabs SSL Server Rating Guide].

The tool is similar in function to  [http://www.foundstone.com/us/resources/proddesc/ssldigger.htm SSLDigger from Foundstone] and [http://freeworld.thc.org/root/tools/ THCSSLCheck from The Hacker Choice] but is different that it is open source and is easily modified to support new protocols and ciphers as they become available and the result is graded.

This project is sponsored by [http://www.omegapoint.se Omegapoint AB] and was created to assist security assessments done according to [http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Testing_Project OWASP Testing Guide].

  * SSL Protocol support detection
  * SSL Cipher support detection
